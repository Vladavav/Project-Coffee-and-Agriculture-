# Project-Coffee-and-Agriculture-
Project "Coffee and Agriculture"

This project utilizes the power of deep learning to classify images of coffee beans and agricultural crops. It showcases the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in tackling real-world visual recognition tasks.

Key Features:

Coffee Bean Color Classification: The project includes a model trained to identify four distinct coffee bean colors (Dark, Green, Light, Medium) from images. This could be helpful for quality control in coffee processing and roasting.
Agricultural Crop Identification: A second model focuses on classifying a variety of common agricultural crops (30 classes), helping farmers and agricultural professionals better understand their fields and optimize their practices.
Top 5 Predicted Categories: The project also provides a feature to display the top 5 most likely classes for an uploaded image, offering a more comprehensive view of the potential classifications. 
User-Friendly Interface: The project leverages Streamlit to create a simple, intuitive web interface where users can easily upload images and receive instant predictions.
Visual Display of Results: The app provides clear and concise results, showing the predicted class and its probability.

This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and provide valuable insights in the coffee and agricultural industries.
